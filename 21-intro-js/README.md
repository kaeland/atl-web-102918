## Intro to Javascript

---

* This week is heavy on abstract concepts.
* Controversial thought: Getting really solid on fundamentals, evaluating code in your head, tracing, etc is more important than learning frameworks like Rails or React.


* History of Javascript
* Loading it in the browser
* Ruby is based on the humble object, Javascript is based on the humble function
* Primitives vs Non-primitive types
  * Symbol, Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String, Object
  * Non-primitive is, well, everything else :P
* Identifying types is harder in JS.
  * typeof is just bad
  * .constructor.name is maybe a little better? Not perfect.
* Falsey values: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN
* Constructors vs Literals
* Functions: Ruby has blocks, procs, lambda. JS just has functions.
* Maybe build out Fibonacci here so we have something interesting to chew on?
* Running tests: see ~/projects/flatiron/labs/js-looping
